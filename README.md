## Introduction

## Install
This repo is easily obtained using Git's `clone` function:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bredeson/Dioscorea-alata-genomics.git

```
The `--recursive` flag above is important for also pulling down the 
software dependencies used in the analyses.

To configure and install the software dependencies, do:
```bash
cd software && make
```
**NOTE**: running `make` above makes some assumptions about the user's
operating system and environment. Please read the individual documenation
pages for each if an error is incurred.
